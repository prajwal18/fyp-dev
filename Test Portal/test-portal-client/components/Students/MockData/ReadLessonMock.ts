            `<p>As stated in Lessons One and Two, a noun is a word that names a person, place, or thing.</p>
            <p>You have learned that there are various kinds of nouns: common and proper nouns, collective nouns, concrete and abstract nouns, and specific and non-specific nouns. You have also learned how to change a noun from singular to plural, and how to make a noun possessive.</p>
            <p>In this lesson, we will learn that all nouns have four qualities known as "properties": <li>gender, </li><li>person,</li><li>number, and</li> <li>case</li></oll></p>`

That is, the gender of a noun is determined not by the grammatical form of the word, but by the sex of the person, place, or thing that is named. Gender, in English, denotes male sex, female sex, either sex, or neither sex.',
        content:

            <p>Feminine gender denotes female sex.<br/>Examples of feminine nouns are as follows: girl, sister, cow, hen, filly, mother, mare, wife, queen, woman, daughter, and aunt.</p>
            <p>Common gender denotes either sex.<br/>Examples of common gender nouns are: birds, cattle, children, citizens, driver, friend, lawyer, neighbor, parent, relative, singer, and worker.</p>
            <p>Neuter gender denotes neither male nor female sex.<br/>Examples of neuter gender nouns are as follows: books, cabinet, city, desk, house, ink, lamp, pen, river, tree.</p>`

            `<p>A first person noun refers to a person who is doing the speaking.<br/>
            Example: "I, John, was on the island of Patmos" (Revelation 1:9).<br/>
            In this sentence, the noun "John" is in the first person because John is the speaker.<p>

            <p>A second person noun refers to a person who is being addressed.<br/>
            Example: "Friends, Romans, and countrymen; lend me your ears."<br/>
            In this famous speech from Julius Caesar, the nouns "friends," "Romans," and "countrymen" are in the second person because they name people who are being spoken to.</p>

            <p>A third person noun refers to a person or thing being spoken about.<br/>
            Example: "In the beginning, God created the earth and sky."<br/>
            The noun "God" is third person because he is the person being discussed.</p>`
